## R_t estimation

Daily estimation of R_t, with full explanation of the algorithm. 

All credits to Kevin Systrom (https://github.com/k-sys/covid-19), apart from very minor changes.  
For understanding to model, I also left his very nice tutorial. This Notebook is for practical purposes. For all other scopes, upvote his project ;)

## R_t estimation new

Daily estimation of R_t, tuned for Luxembourg. 

It has streamed pipeline for estimation and plotting, following algorithms described in the above notebook. It also implements simple nowcasting.
